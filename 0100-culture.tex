The generation ship set off from earth following the result of some planet wide catastrophe. 

The ship was designed for a long distance voyage to a planet selected to likely have become habitable by the time the ship reached it.

The ship set off with 200 passengers, 100 male, 100 female, each passenger was placed into one of 5 categories based on a aggregate genetic score calculated by a physical and gene sequencing scan. This was done to enforce rules allowing for eugenic processes limiting the population and causing positive genetic drift (in terms of ability to survive).

The ship was designed to sustain 500 passengers.

People are forbidden from having children such that the sum of their value (1 being most genetically fit, 5 being least) is greater than 6. 

At birth, a child's genetic information is sequenced and a computer gives it's genetic aggregate score. It is then placed based on position in percentage of the population into one of the 5 numbers. If a child is born with lower genetic aggregate score than everyone currently on the ship it is marked for sterilisation and given a number ``7'' which bans it from procreation. If a child is born with a higher genetic aggregate score than the rest of the population it is numbered ``1''.
